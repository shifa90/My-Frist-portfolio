         <h3>Mission</h3>
  
         <p> Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the Universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up.</p>

        <h3>Vission</h3>
       <p>You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand.

         <h3>Goals</h3>
         <P>Regardless of how hard you work, if you are aiming for the wrong dream, then all that effort will only get you to the wrong destination faster, and that would be extremely disappointing.</P>

     <h1>Develop <br> Without limit</h1>
     <p>I am a big fan of inspirational quotes and affirmations, a habit that I picked up from my mom. She seemed to have a quote for every life situation or question. I remember reading quotes hung on walls in almost every part of our house and seeing her read dozens of books filled with affirmations, quotes, and thought provoking musings. </p>
